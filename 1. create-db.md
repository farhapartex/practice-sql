## Create a Database

Here I first created a user called `devadmin` and then did below operation

* `CREATE DATABASE practice WITH OWNER = devadmin ENCODING = 'UTF8' CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;`

#### OR

* `CREATE DATABASE practice`
* `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE practice TO devadmin;`

Now run following command to move to `practice` database
* `\c practice`
